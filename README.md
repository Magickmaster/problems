## Problems

This is a series of algorithmic challenges I had to solve in the first semester at ETH. I think most worked within expectations. This is early code of mine, and in no way is it the best nor the most efficient way (though efficiency should be pretty high) to solve these problems. Some I didn't do, some I failed at, but anyho here's the code if you want to look at it.

# Dyno

You are the dinosaur in the Chrome browser "no internet" minigame. Your goal is to find out, given a series of cactii and a fixed jump distance, how far could you get.

# Inversions

Given an implementation of mergesort, calculate how many times the values to merge were inverted, as in the bigger value was below the smaller one in the array. 

# Light Coffee

You want to buy coffee and your wallet is too heavy from all the coins you have. You want to buy your coffe using these, maximizing the weight of the coins you give, but also giving perfect change so you don't get anything back. Also you're next up in line so you have to calculate which coins to give quickly. I apparently didn't do this exercise.

# Mountain Trip

Given a list of cities on the sea and in the mountains, decide where your trip should start and end to visit the most mountain cities in a row not interrupted by sea cities (or something like that). I think this one didn't work out that well.

# Sliding Coin

In a versus game of "sliding coin", decide if you can guarantee a win for yourself. The game is played on a directed graph with a coin lying on an initial node. On their turn, the player moves the coin on any edge from the current node. If the other player can't move on his turn, you win.
# Submatrix Sum

Given a matrix (2d array), process it in a way that it supports finding out the sum of values in a submatrix area (ex. the centermost squares, or everything but the first row) in constant time.
